# Weathergram

A weather themed CRUD application built while learning various web technologies.

This project is aligned with the major project from Colt Steele's Udemy course "The Web Developer Bootcamp 2024" - "YelpCamp".

Instead of following along and creating a clone of the app he builds, I have decided to do a few things differently to ensure I think for myself and extend my learning from what is taught on the course.

## Key Differences

### 1. Application Theme

"YelpCamp" is a Yelp style application for reviewing campgrounds where users can leave reviews for places they camp at and these reviews show up on a geo map for other users to browse and read. This kind of app requires the full-stack with an implementation of a database and CRUD.

I have chosen to theme my app around users posting weather observations from wherever they are currently located, including comments and pictures. This should still require the same database and CRUD implementation.

### 2. TypeScript

Colt does not teach TS at all throughout his course and the entire project is written in vanilla JavaScript. I have decided to challenge myself to commence the transition to TS whilst building this project as I know it will be a benefit long-term. Having recently done some work with C/C++, I do miss having everything typed properly!

### 3. TailWindCSS

YelpCamp uses BootStrap for styling. I have no affinity to either framework, but would like to learn more about TailWind, so I am substituting this.

### 4. Testing & CI/CD

Although not in-place yet, I intend to make use of GitHub actions to automate testing and integration of new commits. Subsequently, I also intend to push code to a dev branch instead of directly to main to simulate a more professional work flow.
